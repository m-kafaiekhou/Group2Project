## Project Details ðŸ’»
- This is a Django Fullstack Project and it features a website to order coffee in a coffee shop in tehran. It uses django version 4.2.3 to bring all the new features into the code. We used all the knowledge we gained so far to code a website for the manager who tasked us with this group project. the project tasks start start with a general knowledge over the project structure. As we learned from the details, first we needed to draw an ERD then build the base of the project using django frame-work from there we had to choose our site interface template to style the site. once all of these steps were done we could finaly start the main coding of the app. We bring to you our best, using all we learned from Maktab 98.

## Project Sprints
With all said and done we now start the story of our progress in the project>>>

### Sprint 1 Start with Basics & Build Design

#### ERD(Entity Relationship Diagram)
Everything starts with a good planning, in our case: we programmers need to draw the ERD for our project so we could configure the base build of our database witch alows us to build upon it. you can see our team effort below. first step so chill...

#### Template 
- Choosing a good template was a group effort as well, there were so many obstacles but we could overcome them and choose a good template.

But as you just realized we need to customize this template since it is actually a food bar site. the reason why we chose this is It's simplicity and dominant beauty. Chill, this is going to work. (^-^)


#### Project Setup
In this step the setup for the project is configured and we begin to get into code. and the starting apps are staff & coffeeshop. yay, hooray.


#### Git Init
The git repo was initiated and the files of the project were pushed on the github.

#### Basic Models 
The first build of models in the project are done. using django models module, the basic models that got accepted by our teachers were: 
- Staff(User)
- Order
- OrderItem
- CafeItem
- Review
- ParentCategory
- SubCategory

#### Basic Templates
The Basic layout of the site templates was created in this step(django tags & starting templates).

#### Authentication
A very tricky and chalenging step in the first sprint of the project but it was done with style and elegance. The custome authentication had to be done using phone number. At first it was thought that we need a complete backend for User in this project but then we realized that it wasn't the case, We only needed to customize the username to phone-number.

#### OTP(One Time Password)
In the process of the project a problem was surfaced, which was the security of the user accounts and trust issues of the project. So it was decided to implant an otp system to solve this problem. This system sends a 6-digit one time password to the user which then the user can use to authenticate into website.

#### First Theme Setup
It was time to finally bring the site up with some styles in it. So we thought to do these templates using the chosen theme for the website:
- base.html
- navbar.html
- header.html
- footer.html

#### Gathering Data for the Website
We just realized that we have no idea about what we are going to put on our cafe website.< we are programmers not coffee makers >. So the solution was the answer we always get from our teachers: Go search for it yourself (0_0).

And with this last step the first sprint came to an end.(More coming right up >>>) 
Our journy for the coffee continues...
